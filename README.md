# Genre Track

This is a project created to allow users to track the games they own, their values and their genres. Users can add games to their collections, add genres for their games and sort their games by the genres they've created.

## Built With

* Ruby version: 3.0.0

* Rails 6.1.3.1

* HTML / CSS / Sass

## Getting Started
You will need Ruby ver. 3.0.0 installed on your system, which you can do so by visiting https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and following the directions from there depending on your system. 

Afterward, please install the required gems by running `bundle:install`.
The next step is to create the database for the app, which can be set up by running `rails db:create db:migrate`. 
Finally, you can run **rails s** command to start up the server and use it as you will.

To access the running server, you can visit localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 (the default port, may change if you've used a different setting).

## Running Tests
To run the tests written for this project, you just need to run the code `bundle exec rpsec`. Depending on the changes you've made to the project, they may pass or fail.
